        "✅ Discover how a sophisticated \"Indirect Prompt Injection\" attack can trick an agent into leaking secret data.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Identify the root-cause infrastructure misconfiguration that enables the attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Implement two distinct layers of security controls:\n",

        "Network Egress Controls to lock down the agent's network access.\n",
